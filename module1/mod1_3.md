# M1/3: Variables and Data Types

In order to perform any computation, we need to store data and a way to retrieve it when we need it. Its pretty much the same way we have always done things. Recall when you were given a problem in your mathematics class. What were the first things you did before you got around to solving the problem? Mostly likely if you were like me you decided on some variables x, y, z where some where known and we had to find the unknown. In a program we do the same thing, choose a name for our variables, instead of it being written on paper, Python will store it in RAM and make it available to us whenever we ask for it by name. 

In this unit we will cover variables, how we can assign values to them, how they are stored and how we call retrieve the stored value. As we are getting started it would be helpful to keep in few fundamentals in mind.
- computers work in binary, that is in 0 and 1. Everything is 0/1 for computer.Text, image,movies, sound and even the programs that you are going write. 
- The variables and data they refer to only exist in RAM and are available to us only when program in running.
