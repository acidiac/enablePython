# A customary hello world
print("Hello World!")

# To run this program you can navigate to the folder in command prompt/terminal and type python <filename.py>

# It seems quite straightforward but what really happened here? Let's see what went down.
# When we gave the command <python prg1_hello.py> we ran the script in something called the python interpreter
# Interpreter, as the name suggests interpreted our code print("Hello World!") as a command to print out 
# whatever was between the parenthesis. print() is a function that is internal to python language. Other languages
# have similar functinalities such as printf() in c, cout in c++, console.log() in javascript and so on. Each of these
# languages also have their own interpreter or compiler which will do exactly what python interpret just did for us.


# At this point, you might think if all of the languages are essentially doing the same things, whats the point of
# having so many languages? Doesn't that make everything more complicated? I thought programs were making things simpler
# and efficient.
