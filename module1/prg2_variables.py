# Variables ===========================================================
# The variables are a convenient naming mechanism for our data. 
# In essence variable is a name that refers to a value.
# =====================================================================

# Assigning Values to Variables =======================================
# we can assign values to a name(variable) by using "=" operator. 
# <variable_name> = value 
# Variable name is on the left hand and value on the right
# Once assigned the values can be used by refering to the variable name
# =====================================================================


my_name = "Amit"
# we can use print() to print it out
print(my_name)

# How do we pick a varibale name ======================================
# As we all know picking a name can be tricky, there are few things we
# must keep in mind when picking a variable name.
# 1. You must avoid ambiguity.It must be explicit
# 2. You cannot use a number in the beginning of variable name
# 3. You cannot use reserved keywords 
# 4. Use a style that you prefer, camel case or underscores
# 5. Be consistent
# =====================================================================

# let's say we are trying write a program for generating marksheets
mark_1 = 80 # this is ambiguous, what is mark_1
marksMaths = 80 # this is better, we know what we are referring to


# Reserved Words ======================================================
# False class finally is return None continue for lambda try True def
# from nonlocal while and del global not with as elif if or yield
# assert else import pass break except in raise
# =====================================================================
